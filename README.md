  ## Description
  This a text editor developed for programmers to be able to write down code snippets wherever they may be and save them on their phone and/or laptop. It is downloadable and works without an internet connection.
  ## Installation
  Navigate to https://jate-programmerschoice.herokuapp.com/ and click the installed project. If you want to install the actual code, then clone or fork the repo. Then, run `npm i` followed by `npm start:dev` in order to create the distribution folder. You'll notice that the distribution folder is not in the repo. It was included in the git ignore so if you would like to see how that wourks, you will need to install by the second method rather than installing from the heroku app.
  ## Usage
  Someone would use this app to write down code snippets that they don't want to forget. Or maybe they just want to `console.log('Remember to grab milk at the store')`
